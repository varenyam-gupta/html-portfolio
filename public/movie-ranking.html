 <h2>My top 3 movies/shows of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
 <p>The GOAT. Haven't seen anything close to it. The plot, the story, the action, the animation - everything blows my mind away questioning how far a human can actually think!</p>
 <h3>Your Name</h3>
 <p>The most beautiful movie I have ever watched. The BGM and the posters always make me want to rewatch this.</p>
 <h3>Death Note</h3>
 <p>The battle between the masterminds! Not much action but the plot and IQ of characters will blow your mind away!</p>
